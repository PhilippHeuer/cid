Run your continuous integration and deployment workflows in a platform-agnostic way!

- **Platform Agnostic** - Your workflow works locally and on any repository/pipeline service of your choice. -> the [normalize.ci](https://github.com/cidverse/normalizeci) component normalizes all environment variables into a global format.
- **Fast Feedback** - Rather than having to commit/push/wait every time you want to test out the changes you are making to your continuous integration and deployment process, you can use `cid` to run/test your workflow locally. `cid` can provide normalized environment variables as the ci service would based on scm repository information.
